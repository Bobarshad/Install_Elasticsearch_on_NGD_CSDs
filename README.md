# Running Elasticsearch on The NGD Systems Computational Storage Drives  “CSDs”

# What is Elasticsearch? 
Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability, Elasticsearch is the central component of the Elastic Stack, a set of open source tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis, and visualization.

# Elasticsearch & NGD Computational Storage Drives
Here our goal is to highlight how taking a distributed Elasticsearch toolset and distributing across NGD Computational Storage Drives can provide the necessary support to increase performance and reduce system complexity to accomplish the goal of proper data management. Using Computational Storage Drives to offload the initial work required, you can substantially reduce the amount of round robin data movement and time associated with it to get the desired results.
